	<h2>Configure and create your own FLOAT Events.</h2>
	<p>
		Whether it be a <span class="twitter">Twitter space</span>,
		<span class="discord">Discord call</span>,
		<span class="youtube">YouTube livestream</span>, IRL event, or anything at
		all, you can create a FLOAT Event so participants can remember and have
		proof that they were there.
	</p>

	<h2>Cherish your favorite memories #onFlow.</h2>
	<p>
		Claim FLOATs and show them off as proof that <strong>you</strong> were there.
	</p>

	<h2 id="distribute-directly">Reward users for taking certain actions.</h2>
	<p>
		FLOATs can be configured to only be distributed by the creator. You can do
		this by selecting <span class="emphasis">Not Claimable</span> on the
		<a href="/create">/create</a>
		page. This means the creator can send FLOATs in their own custom transactions
		to reward their community. Want to give people proof that they participated in
		your token drop? Give them a FLOAT automatically in your transaction code when
		the user purchases the NFT.
	</p>

	<h2 id="distribute-directly">Configure your events however you want.</h2>
	<p>
		Want to prevent users from transferring your FLOATs? Want to put a time
		limit or max capacity on your event? Configure your events however you want
		on the <a href="/create">/create</a> page.
	</p>

	<h2 id="distribute-directly">Rules</h2>
	<p>
		No nudity or any imagery involving sexual content. You will be immediately
		banned from the platform.
