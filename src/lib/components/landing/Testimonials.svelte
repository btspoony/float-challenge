                I created a Float for my Twitch viewers that served as an entry
                for future giveaways. It was extremely easy to set up and very
                user friendly for my viewers to collect the Float. For 85-90% of
                them - it was their first NFT! Floats are great for groups!

                I love the potential that exists with FLOATS - being able to
                gate exclusive access to something, and for the host to be able
                to find a way to reward those who attended later on! It paves a
                way for new possibilities on web3

                Floats brought an important ability to Flow. They allow anyone
                to create a proof of attendance or a proof of support. Being
                able to verify if someone owns a specific float, allows
                community leaders to create gated areas in discords using the
                Emerald Bot! I am very grateful. ♥️

                FLOATs are practical, easy to use, and brings an extra layer of
                fun within the web3 community. Creating or claiming a FLOAT
                couldn’t be easier. Thanks Emerald City!

                FLOATs bring the ability for community groups to celebrate their
                collections, their fandom, their shared experience. With FLOATs,
                anyone can take part in the fun of web3 without worrying about
                barriers such as technical know-how, cost of entry, potential
                for bad actors, etc. <br /><br />
                They truly represent a key part of bringing a billion people to the
                blockchain and I can't wait to see how they evolve and grow over
                time.
